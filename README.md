# Chocolate-Bars-Python
Analysis of chocolate bar ratings using Python.

## Objective
Brady Brelinski, founding member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society, reviews plain origin chocolate bars and rates them on a scale of 1 to 5 based on their flavour, texture and other criteria.
One of the factors influencing a chocolate bar’s taste is the amount of cocoa it contains.

The focus of this project, therefore, was the relationship between a chocolate bar’s cocoa content and its rating.

## Key Questions?
- Is there a relationship between a chocolate bar's cocoa content and its rating?
- Is it possible to predict a chocolate bar's rating solely based on its cocoa content?

## Data
flavors_of_cacao: This data set contains ratings for chocolate bars as well as their cocoa content and information about the manufacturer and the used bean type for the time range 2006-2017.
